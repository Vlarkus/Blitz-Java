IMPLEMENT:
- Speed Menu with voltage calculations.
- Viewing modes: Basic, Speed.
- Add Window to edit speed of the curve.
- Add Tutorials to the Help Menu Option.
- Control Point highlights if you hover it with a tool you can edit it.
- Animate the 18x18 robot box so that it travels around the path in a continous loop (aditional tool)

COOL TO HAVE:
- Use triangles for bezier pointers to show direction.
- Pointers highlight if a tool can work with them and if a cursor is over the pointer.
- Ability to change color of different trajectories.
- Edit Time Frame has buttons with preset actions (set all max, set average, reser to last saved change, save button, etc.)
- CTRL + Z
- User can choose what coordinate system they want to use upon export. Examples: 0,0 in the center, 0,0 is the starting control point, 0,0 is some another place.

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Add optimization mode, so that when you move a curve, it uses smaller coeff-s for calculating curves, but once you release them, it is recalculated with a higher precision.
- Make the curves to calculate max of 4 decimal digits, so they dont waste time.
- Make the CanvasPanel store the points differently, based on the curves. That way it only needs to update the active curve, as you can only change active curves. Basically, rerender only active curves.
